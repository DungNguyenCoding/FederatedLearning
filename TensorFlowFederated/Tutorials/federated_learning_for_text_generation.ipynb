        "In particular, we load a previously trained Keras model, and refine it using  federated training on a (simulated) decentralized dataset. This is practically important for several reasons . The ability to use serialized models makes it easy to mix federated learning with other ML approaches. Further, this allows use of an increasing range of pre-trained models --- for example, training language models from scratch is rarely necessary, as numerous pre-trained models are now widely available (see, e.g., [TF Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)). Instead, it makes more sense to start from a pre-trained model, and refine it using Federated Learning, adapting to the particular characteristics of the decentralized data for a particular application.\n",

        "For this tutorial, we start with a RNN that generates ASCII characters, and refine it via federated learning. We also show how the final weights can be fed back to the original Keras model, allowing easy evaluation and text generation using standard tools."
